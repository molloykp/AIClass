<h3> Learning Objectives </h3>
<i>After completing this activity, students should be able to:</i>
<ul>
<li>Construct uniformed (BFS, DFS, IDS) and informed (A*) search algorithms
</li>
</ul>

This assignment includes an <b>autograder</b>, which can be run
with the following command:<pre><code>python autograder.py</code></pre>


<h3>Partners</h3>
This assignment may be completed individually or in pairs.
<b>If you are doing this in pairs, you must notify me at the beginning
of the project.</b>
My expectation for pairs is that both members are
actively involved, and take full responsibility for all aspects
of the project.  In other words, I expect that you are either
sitting or virtually together to work, and not that you are splitting
up tasks to be completed separately.  If both members of the
group are not able to fully explain the code to me, then
this does not meet this expectation.

<h2>Running Pacman</h2>
<div style="padding-left:2em;">
    <p>
    After download the code (<a href="PA_01/search.zip">search.zip</a>), unzipping it, and changing to the
    search directory (created via unzip), you should be able to play a game of pacman.  Make sure
    your python environment is configured (see resources) and then enter the following at the command line:
    <pre><code>python pacman.py</code></pre>
    <p>
    Pacman lives in a shiny blue world of twisting corridors and tasty round treats.
    Navigating this world efficiently will be Pacman’s first step in mastering his domain.
    </p>
    <p>
        The simplest agent in <code class="hlr">searchAgents.py</code> is called the
        <code class="hlr">GoWestAgent</code>,
        which always goes West (a trivial reflex agent). This agent can occasionally win:
        <pre><code>python pacman.py --layout testMaze --pacman GoWestAgent</code></pre>
    </p>
    But, things get ugly for this agent when turning is required:
    <pre><code>python pacman.py --layout tinyMaze --pacman GoWestAgent</code></pre>
    <p>If Pacman gets stuck, you can exit the game by typing CTRL-c into your terminal.</p>

    <p>
        Soon, your agent will solve not only <code class="hlr">tinyMaze</code>, but any maze you want.
    </p>
    <p>
    Note that <code class="hlr">pacman.py</code>supports a number of options that can each be expressed in a
    long way (e.g., <code class="hlr">--layout</code>) or a short way (e.g., <code class="hlr">-l</code>).
    You can see the list of all options and their default values via:
    <pre><code>python pacman.py -h</code></pre>
    Also, all of the commands that appear in this project also appear in commands.txt,
    for easy copying and pasting.
    In UNIX/Mac OS X, you can even run all these commands in order with bash commands.txt.
    </p>
</div>


<h2> Question 1: Finding a Fixed Food Dot using Depth First Search (3 points)</h2>
<div style="padding-left:2em;">
    <p>>
    In  <code class="hlr">searchAgents.py</code>, you’ll find a fully implemented
        <code class="hlr">searchAgent</code>,
    which plans out a path through Pacman’s world and then executes that path step-by-step.
    The search algorithms for formulating a plan are not implemented – that’s your job.
    </p>
    <p>
    First, test that the  <code class="hlr">searchAgent</code> is working correctly by running:
    <pre><code>python pacman.py -l tinyMaze -p SearchAgent -a fn=tinyMazeSearch</code></pre>

    The command above tells the SearchAgent to use tinyMazeSearch as its search algorithm,
    which is implemented in search.py. Pacman should navigate the maze successfully.
    </p>

    <p>
    Now it’s time to write full-fledged generic search functions to help Pacman plan routes!
    Pseudocode for the search algorithms you’ll write can be found in the lecture slides. Remember
    that a search node must contain not only a state but also the information necessary to reconstruct
    the path (plan) which gets to that state.
    </p>
    <p>
    <b>Important note:</b> All of your search functions need to return a list of actions that will
    lead the agent from the start to the goal. These actions all have to be legal moves
    (valid directions, no moving through walls).
    </p>
    <p>
    <b>Important note:</b> Make sure to use the Stack, Queue and PriorityQueue data structures
    provided to you in util.py! These data structure implementations have particular
    properties which are required for compatibility with the autograder.
    </p>
    <p>
    <b>Hint</b>: Each algorithm is very similar. Algorithms for DFS, BFS, UCS, and A* differ only in
    the details of how the fringe is managed. So, concentrate on getting DFS right and the rest
    should be relatively straightforward. Indeed, one possible implementation requires only a
    single generic search method which is configured with an algorithm-specific queuing
    strategy. (Your implementation need not be of this form to receive full credit).
    </p>
    <p>
        Implement the depth-first search (DFS) algorithm in the depthFirstSearch function
    in search.py. To make your algorithm complete, write the graph search version of DFS,
    which avoids expanding any already visited states.
    </p>

    <p>
    Your code should quickly find a solution for:
    <pre><code>python pacman.py -l tinyMaze -p SearchAgent</code></pre><br/>
    <pre><code>python pacman.py -l mediumMaze -p SearchAgent</code></pre><br/>
    <pre><code>python pacman.py -l bigMaze -z .5 -p SearchAgent</code></pre>

    The Pacman board will show an overlay of the states explored,
    and the order in which they were explored (brighter red means earlier exploration).
    Is the exploration order what you would have expected? Does Pacman actually go to all
    the explored squares on his way to the goal?
    </p>
    <p>
    <b>Hint:</b> If you use a Stack as your data structure, the solution found by your
    DFS algorithm for mediumMaze should have a length of 130
    (provided you push successors onto the fringe in the order provided by
    getSuccessors; you might get 246 if you push them in the reverse order).
    Is this a least cost solution? If not, think about what depth-first search is doing wrong.
    </p>
</div>

<hr/>
<h2> Question 2: Breadth First Search (3 points)</h2>
<div style="padding-left:2em;">
    <p>
Implement the breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm in the  <code class="hlr">breadthFirstSearch</code>
    function in <code class="hlr">search.py</code>
        Again, write a graph search algorithm that avoids
    expanding any already visited states. Test your code the same way you did for
    depth-first search.
    Does BFS find a least cost solution? If not, check your implementation.
    </p>
    <p>
    <i>Hint</i>: If Pacman moves too slowly for you, try the option <code class="hlr">--frameTime 0</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Note:</b> If you’ve written your search code generically,
    your code should work equally well for the eight-puzzle search problem without any changes.
<pre><code>python pacman.py -l mediumMaze -p SearchAgent -a fn=bfs</code></pre><br/>
<pre><code>python pacman.py -l bigMaze -z .5 -p SearchAgent</code></pre>
   </p>
</div>


<hr />
<h2> Question 3: Varying the Cost Function(3 points)</h2>
<div style="padding-left:2em;">
    <p>
    While BFS will find a fewest-actions path to the goal, we might want to find paths that are “best”
    in other senses. Consider  <code class="hlr">mediumDottedMaze</code> and
    <code class="hlr">mediumScaryMaze</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
    By changing the cost function, we can encourage Pacman to find different paths.
    For example, we can charge more for dangerous steps in ghost-ridden areas or less for steps
    in food-rich areas, and a rational Pacman agent should adjust its behavior in response.
    </p>
    <p>
    Implement the uniform-cost graph search algorithm in the
        <code class="hlr">uniformCostSearch</code>  function
    in <code class="hlr">search.py</code>. We encourage you to look through
        <code class="hlr">util.py</code> for some data structures that
    may be useful in your implementation. You should now observe successful behavior
    in all three of the following layouts, where the agents below are all UCS agents that differ
    only in the cost function they use (the agents and cost functions are written for you):
    <pre><code>python pacman.py -l mediumMaze -p SearchAgent -a fn=ucs</code></pre><br/>
    <pre><code>python pacman.py -l mediumDottedMaze -p StayEastSearchAgent</code></pre><br/>
    <pre><code>python pacman.py -l mediumScaryMaze -p StayWestSearchAgent</code></pre>
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Note:</b> You should get very low and very high path costs for the
        <code class="hlr">StayEastSearchAgent</code> and
        <code class="hlr">StayWestSearchAgent</code>  respectively,
    due to their exponential cost functions (see
        <code class="hlr">searchAgents.py</code>  for details).
    </p>
</div>

<hr/>
<h2> Question 4: A* Search(3 points)</h2>
<div style="padding-left:2em;">
    <p>
    Implement A* graph search in the empty function
    <code class="hlr">aStarSearch</code>  in
    <code class="hlr">search.py</code>.
    A* takes a heuristic function as an argument.
    Heuristics take two arguments: a state in the search problem
    (the main argument), and the problem itself (for reference information).
    The <code class="hlr">nullHeuristic</code> heuristic function in
    <code class="hlr">search.py</code>  is a trivial example.
    </p>
    <p>
    You can test your A* implementation on the original problem of finding a
    path through a maze to a fixed position using the Manhattan distance
    heuristic (implemented already as
        <code class="hlr">manhattanHeuristic</code>  in   <code class="hlr">searchAgents.py</code>).
    <pre><code>python pacman.py -l bigMaze -z .5 -p SearchAgent -a fn=astar,heuristic=manhattanHeuristic</code></pre>
    </p>
    <p>
    You should see that A* finds the optimal solution slightly faster than uniform
    cost search (about 549 vs. 620 search nodes expanded in our implementation, but
    ties in priority may make your numbers differ slightly). What happens on
        <code class="hlr">openMaze</code>
    for the various search strategies?
    </p>
</div>

<hr/>
<h2> Question 5: Finding All the Corners (3 points)</h2>
<div style="padding-left:2em;">
    <p>
    The real power of A* will only be apparent with a more challenging search problem.
    Now, it’s time to formulate a new problem and design a heuristic for it.
    </p>
    <p>
    In <i>corner mazes</i>, there are four dots, one in each corner.
    Our new search problem is to find the shortest path through the maze that
    touches all four corners (whether the maze actually has food there or not).
    Note that for some mazes like <code class="hlr">tinyCorners</code>, the shortest path does not always go to the
    closest food first! Hint: the shortest path through  <code class="hlr">tinyCorners</code> takes 28 steps.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Note:</b> Make sure to complete Question 2 before working on Question 5, because Question
    5 builds upon your answer for Question 2.
    </p>
    <p>
    Implement the  <code class="hlr">CornersProblem</code> search problem in
        <code class="hlr">searchAgents.py</code>. You will need to
    choose a state representation that encodes all the information necessary to detect whether
    all four corners have been reached. Now, your search agent should solve:

    <pre><code>python pacman.py -l tinyCorners -p SearchAgent -a fn=bfs,prob=CornersProblem</code></pre><br/>
    <pre><code>python pacman.py -l mediumCorners -p SearchAgent -a fn=bfs,prob=CornersProblem</code></pre><br/>

    To receive full credit, you need to define an abstract state representation that does not encode
    irrelevant information (like the position of ghosts, where extra food is, etc.). In particular,
    do not use a Pacman GameState as a search state. Your code will be very, very slow if
    you do (and also wrong).
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Hint:</b> The only parts of the game state you need to reference in your implementation are
    the starting Pacman position and the location of the four corners.
    </p>
    <p>
    Our implementation of         <code class="hlr">breadthFirstSearch</code> expands just under 2000
        search nodes on <code class="hlr">mediumCorners</code>.
        However, heuristics (used with A* search) can reduce the amount of searching required.
    </p>
</div>

<hr/>
<h2> Question 6: Corners Problem: Heuristic (3 points)</h2>
<div style="padding-left:2em;">
    <p>
        <b>Note:</b>
        Make sure to complete Question 4 before working on Question 6, because
        Question 6 builds upon your answer for Question 4.
    </p>
    <p>
    Implement a non-trivial, consistent heuristic for the  <code class="hlr">CornersProblem</code> in
        <code class="hlr">cornersHeuristic</code>.
    <pre><code>python pacman.py -l mediumCorners -p AStarCornersAgent -z 0.5</code></pre>
     </p>
    <p>
    <b>Note:</b>  <code class="hlr">AStarCornersAgent</code> is a shortcut for
    <pre><code>-p SearchAgent -a fn=aStarSearch,prob=CornersProblem,heuristic=cornersHeuristic</code></pre>
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Admissibility vs. Consistency:</b> Remember, heuristics are just functions that take search states and
    return numbers that estimate the cost to a nearest goal. More effective heuristics will return values
    closer to the actual goal costs. To be admissible, the heuristic values must be lower bounds on
    the actual shortest path cost to the nearest goal (and non-negative). To be consistent, it must
    additionally hold that if an action has cost c, then taking that action can only cause a drop in
    heuristic of at most c.
    </p>
    <p>
    Remember that admissibility isn’t enough to guarantee correctness in graph search – you
    need the stronger condition of consistency. However, admissible heuristics
    are usually also consistent, especially if they are derived from problem relaxations.
    Therefore it is usually easiest to start out by brainstorming admissible heuristics.
    Once you have an admissible heuristic that works well, you can check whether it is indeed
    consistent, too. The only way to guarantee consistency is with a proof. However, inconsistency
    can often be detected by verifying that for each node you expand, its successor nodes are equal
    or higher in in f-value. Moreover, if UCS and A* ever return paths of different lengths, your
    heuristic is inconsistent. This stuff is tricky!
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Non-Trivial Heuristics:</b> The trivial heuristics are the ones that return zero everywhere (UCS)
    and the heuristic which computes the true completion cost. The former won’t save you any time,
    while the latter will timeout the autograder. You want a heuristic which reduces total compute
    time, though for this assignment the autograder will only check node counts (aside from enforcing
    a reasonable time limit).
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Grading:</b> Your heuristic must be a non-trivial non-negative consistent heuristic to receive any
    points. Make sure that your heuristic returns 0 at every goal state and never returns a
    negative value. Depending on how few nodes your heuristic expands, you’ll be graded:

    <table class="table-responsive-sm table-bordered">
    <col style="width:20%">
    <col style="width:20%">
    <thead>
      <td>Number of nodes expanded</td>
      <td>Grade</td>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
        <td>more than 2000</td><td>0/3</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>at most 2000</td><td>1/3</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>at most 1600</td><td>2/3</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>at most 1200</td><td>3/3</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>
    Remember: If your heuristic is inconsistent, you will receive no credit, so be careful!

</div>

<hr/>
<h2> Question 7: Eating all the Dots (4 points)</h2>
<div style="padding-left:2em;">
    <p>
    Now we’ll solve a hard search problem: eating all the Pacman food in as few steps as
    possible. For this, we’ll need a new search problem definition which formalizes the
    food-clearing problem:
        <code class="hlr">FoodSearchProblem</code>  in
        <code class="hlr">searchAgents.py</code>  (implemented for you).
    A solution is defined to be a path that collects all of the food in the Pacman world.
    For the present project, solutions do not take into account any ghosts or power pellets;
    solutions only depend on the placement of walls, regular food and Pacman. (Of
    course ghosts can ruin the execution of a solution! We’ll get to that in the next
    project.) If you have written your general search methods correctly,
    A* with a null heuristic (equivalent to uniform-cost search) should quickly find
    an optimal solution to testSearch with no code change on your part (total cost of 7).

    <pre><code>python pacman.py -l testSearch -p AStarFoodSearchAgent</code></pre>
    Note: <code class="hlr">AStarFoodSearchAgent</code> is a shortcut for
    <pre><code>-p SearchAgent -a fn=astar,prob=FoodSearchProblem,heuristic=foodHeuristic</code></pre>

    You should find that UCS starts to slow down even for the seemingly simple
    <code class="hlr">tinySearch</code>.
    As a reference, our implementation takes 2.5 seconds to find a path of length 27 after
    expanding 5057 search nodes.
    </p>
    <p>
    Note: Make sure to complete Question 4 before working on Question 7, because
    Question 7 builds upon your answer for Question 4.
    </p>
    <p>
    Fill in  <code class="hlr">foodHeuristic</code> in <code class="hlr">searchAgents.py</code>
        with a consistent heuristic for
    the <code class="hlr">FoodSearchProblem</code>. Try your agent on the
        <code class="hlr">trickySearch</code> board:
    <pre><code>python pacman.py -l trickySearch -p AStarFoodSearchAgent</code></pre>
    Our UCS agent finds the optimal solution in about 13 seconds, exploring over 16,000 nodes.
    </p>
    <p>
    Any non-trivial non-negative consistent heuristic will receive 1 point.
    Make sure that your heuristic returns 0 at every goal state and never returns
    a negative value. Depending on how few nodes your heuristic expands, you’ll get
    additional points:
    <table class="table-responsive-sm table-bordered">
        <col style="width:20%">
        <col style="width:20%">

<h2> Question 8: Suboptimal Search (3 points)</h2>
<div style="padding-left:2em;">
    <p>
    Sometimes, even with A* and a good heuristic, finding the optimal path through
    all the dots is hard. In these cases, we’d still like to find a reasonably good
    path, quickly. In this section, you’ll write an agent that always greedily eats the closest
    dot.  <code class="hlr">ClosestDotSearchAgent</code> is implemented for you in
        <code class="hlr">searchAgents.py</code>, but it’s
    missing a key function that finds a path to the closest dot.
    </p>
    <p>
    Implement the function <code class="hlr">findPathToClosestDot</code>
        in <code class="hlr">searchAgents.py</code>.
    Our agent solves this maze (suboptimally!) in under a second with a path cost of 350:
    <pre><code>python pacman.py -l bigSearch -p ClosestDotSearchAgent -z .5</code></pre>
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Hint:</b> The quickest way to complete <code class="hlr">findPathToClosestDot</code> is to
    fill in the <code class="hlr">AnyFoodSearchProblem</code>, which is missing its goal test. Then, solve
    that problem with an appropriate search function. The solution should be very short!
    </p>
    <p>
    Your <code class="hlr">ClosestDotSearchAgent</code> won’t always find the shortest possible
    path through the maze. Make sure you understand why and try to come up with a
    small example where repeatedly going to the closest dot does not result in finding
    the shortest path for eating all the dots.
