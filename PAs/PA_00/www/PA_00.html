<h3> PA 0: Setup Development Environment </h3>

<h4> Goals </h4>
<!-- <div style="padding-left:2em;padding-bottom:.50rem;"> -->
<div class="pl-2 pb-2">
    The purpose of this programming assignment is to:
    <ul>
      <li>Setup your Python programming environment </li>
      <li>provide resources to help you get up-to-speed with the Python programming language </li>
    </ul>
</div>

<h4>Part 1: Setup Development Environment</h4>
<div style="padding-left:2em;">
    You will need to construct your Python development
    environment.  Instructions that detail how to setup your
    <a href="../../resources/workStationConfig.php">
    development environment are located here </a>.
</div>

<h4>Part 2: Play Some Pacman</h4>
<div style="padding-left:2em;">
    Download the <a href="PA_01/search.zip"> search.zip </a> file for PA01 and
    unzip it.  Change into the directory created when unzipping it named
    search. Make sure your python environment is configured (see
    resources) and then enter the following at the command line:
    <pre><code>python pacman.py</code></pre>.  Take a screen shot of Pacman running on your
    computer and submit it to Canvas.  This is the only devliverable for this
    PA.
</div>

<h4>Part 3: Warm up (optional)</h4>
<div class="pl-3 pb-2">
    Get started by completing one or both of the following
    online tutorials:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/tutorial"
             target="_blank">
             https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/tutorial</a>
      </li>
       <li><a href="http://www.learnpython.org" target="_blank">
            http://www.learnpython.org</a>
      </li>
    </ul>

    Once you have completed the tutorials above, log into
    <a href="https://codingbat.com/python">Coding Bat</a>.
    <p>
        You can complete as many of these as you feel necessary.
    </p>

    <p>
        Feel free to skim the tutorials above if you are already comfortable
        programming in Python. If you are new to Python, I <b>strongly</b> encourage
        you to work through each step of the tutorials carefully. It will probably
        take a couple of hours, but the time spent will pay dividends
        throughout the semester.
    </p>

<h2>Submission</h2>
<div class="pl-3 pb-2">
    <p>
    You should submit the screenshot of Pacman running on your
        computer to Canvas.

<hr/>
    Many of the pacman modules were originally developed by Pieter Abbeel, Nick Hay,
    and Dan Klein along with UC Berkeley.<br/>
