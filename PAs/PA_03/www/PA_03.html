<h2> PA2: Map Coloring using Min Conflicts </h2>
<p><img src="PA_02/USA4Color.png" alt="USA 4 Color" class="center-image img-fluid" style="width: 400px;" /></p>

<h3> Learning Objectives </h3>
<i>After completing this activity, students should be able to:</i>
<ul>
<li>
   Implement a min-conflicts approach to map coloring (or in general,
    binary constraints embedded within a graph).
</li>
<li>Analyze the statistical variance in solution
times for the map coloring problem with
an iterative/random approach</li>
</ul>

This assignment includes an <b>autograder</b>, which can be run on
the Australia example using the following command (assuming your
solution pickle file is named australia_solution.pickle):<pre><code>
    python autograder.py --inputFile australia_mapcolor.csv --colorCount 3 --solutionFile australia_solution.pickle
</code></pre>

The autograder simply verifies that the assignment meets all the constraints.
You can and should run the autograder on your solutions
for the USA and tv show datasets.

<h3>Partners</h3>
This assignment may be completed individually or in pairs.
<b>If you are doing this in pairs, you must notify me at the beginning
of the project.</b>
My expectation for pairs is that both members are
actively involved, and take full responsibility for all aspects
of the project.  In other words, I expect that you are either
sitting or virtually together to work, and not that you are splitting
up tasks to be completed separately.  If both members of the
group are not able to fully explain the code to me, then
this does not meet this expectation.

<h3>Submission and Policies</h3>

You must submit the following files:
<ul>
    <li><code class="hlr">cs444_pa2_csp.py</code> to
        <a href="https://autolab.cs.jmu.edu">Autolab</a>.
    Your code should assign valid solutions and create validate solution
    files for all 3 input files.  Autolab will use a few additional
    hidden test cases to validate your program.
    </li>
    <li>A PDF report to Canvas that contains the following information:
    <ul>
        <li>A paragraph or two that describes how your program handles the
        situation when it is not possible to color the map with the supplied
        number of colors is too low.  To test this, try using the Australia example
        with k = 2.</li>
        <li>A paragraph that described how you determined the minimum number
        of colors for the TV shows dataset and the value you found for
            the minimum number of colors.  For example, "I was able
        to color the TV Shows graph with 100 colors" (FYI, you
        should be able to do it in less than 100). </li>
        <li>An analysis of the runtime behavior.  Run your program 30 times
        on the USA map coloring problem with k = 4.  Plot a histogram (the
        same as the last assignment) that shows the distribution of the
        number of iterations it took your program to find a solution.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    <b>Evaluation:</b>
    Your code will be autograded for technical correctness. Please do not change the names of any
    provided functions or classes within the code, or you will wreak havoc on the autograder. However,
    the correctness of your implementation – not the autograder’s judgements –
    will be the final judge of your score. If necessary, I will review and grade assignments individually
    to ensure that you receive due credit for your work.
</p>
<p>
<b>Academic Dishonesty</b>: Your code will be checked
    against other submissions in the class for logical redundancy. If you copy someone else’s code and submit it with minor changes,
    it will be detected. These cheat detectors are quite hard to fool, so please don’t try.
    I trust you all to submit your own team's work; please don’t let us down.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Getting Help:</b> You are not alone! If you find yourself stuck on something, contact me.
    Office hours and Piazza discussion forum are there for your support; please use them.
    If you can’t make office hours, let me know and I will schedule a meeting with you. I want these projects to be
    rewarding and instructional, not frustrating and demoralizing.
    But, I don’t know when or how to help unless you ask.

<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<div style="padding-left:2em;">
    <p>
    In this assignment, you will construct a python program that implements
        the min-conflict algorithm to solve a map coloring problem.
        You will be given a graph  <i>G=(V,E)</i> and
        must find an assignment of colors such that
        if two vertices are adjacent (an edge exists between them),
        the vertices must not be assigned the same color.

        </p>
    <p>
        The secondary objective of this assignment
        is to find the minimum number of colors needed, <i>k</i>, in order to
        not violate any of these constraints on the TV shows dataset.  This is known
        as the <i>Chromatic Number</i> (Diaz, Zabala 1999).  For planar graphs,
        there are some theories on the minimum number of colors you will need
        (see informative section below).  However, for nonplanar graphs (such
        as tvshow_edges.csv), you will need to explore different values of
        k (the number of colors available).  This number and your technique must
        be contained with the PDF you submit to Canvas.
    </p>

    <p> An <a href="https://mathigon.org/course/graph-theory/map-colouring">interactive application</a>
        for solving this problem is available if you want to experiment with it.
    </p>

    <p>In designing your method, you will need to consider some questions that make
        utilizing min-conflicts challenging.  Some of these questions may be
        very graph/problem dependent, such as:
    <ul>
      <li>What happens in your method if you set <i>k</i> too small?</li>
      <li>How will you determine the minimum setting of <i>k</i>?</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>The starter code will read in the provided csv files into an  adjacency list
        representation of a graph. The code also takes this representation and saves a
        dictionary containing the solution to a file known as a
        <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/pickle-python-tutorial">python pickle</a>,
        which provides a mechanism for object serialization.  The autograder reads this
        pickle file and validates the solution is correct.
    </p>

    <p>
        Submissions will be graded according to the following rubric:
    </p>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-sm-6">
    <table class="table table-responsive-sm  table-bordered">
        <tr>

        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td>Coding style</td>
            <td>10% </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td>PDF report contains the required
            paragraphs on how your program addresses the
            case when too few colors are specified, the number
                of colors your solution found for the tvshows dataset, and also the
            histogram plot.</td>
            <td>20%</td>

<h2>Theorem on Map Coloring</h2>
<div style="padding-left:2em;">
    <p>>
        This section contains some supplemental information
        about map coloring (in other words, this information is not strictly
        needed to complete the proejct).
        Considered to be the first major theorem to be proved using a computer, the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_color_theorem">four color theorem</a>
        was published in 1977 by Appel and Haken.  The proof illustrates that
        any planar graph (a graph that can be drawn in a plane such that its
        edges intersect only at their endpoints/vertices) is 4 colorable.  Examples
        of a planar and nonplanar graph are shown below.  The input to this project
        will not necessarily be planar.
